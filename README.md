# DiffractionPySim
This repository includes the Python scripts and functions that can be used to simulate diffraction limited spots in the presence of Gaussian noise.

Developed by Alexandros Papagiannakis, Stanford University, 2025.

An example which summarizes the functions and how they can be used to generate diffraction limited spots is presented in the "Diffraction_limited_simulation.ipynb" notebook.
